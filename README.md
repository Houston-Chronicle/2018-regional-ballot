# 2018 Regional Ballot
This is a single-page application built by the Houston Chronicle for the 2018 general elections. This app will serve as a way for readers to see all the candidates on their ballot based on county for the eight-county region the Chronicle covers.
## What we built this with
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) made up the backbone of this app, with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) acting as the CSS framework.
## Contributors
Special thanks to Jasper Scherer and Massarah Mikati, who fact-checked the different counties' ballots to make sure everything was accurate. This interactive would also not have been possible without the assistance of Rachael Gleason and Matt Dempsey, whose assistance in cleaning the data and feedback on design was invaluable.
